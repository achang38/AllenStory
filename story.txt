Al went out to the library on Monday night.
The sidewalks were so icy and slippery that he fell down and broke his foot.
He had to go to the hospital and miss schol because of this.

Because of his foot
Allen had a hard time walking to class
And he fell on the icy road again
But this time
It's not all terrible
A beautiful girl helps him get up

"U alright?" asked the girl
"yeah I'm fine. Thanks!...ahh" Al tried to make a step forward
but his ankel hurts so badly
"where do you live? I've got no class this afternoon
I can probably help you get home if it's not too far"
Al wanted to say no, but his ankel looks no good
he glanced at the girl's eyes
she seems a little shy and moved her eyes away quickly...
