Al went out to the library on Monday night.
The sidewalks were so icy and slippery that he fell down and broke his foot.
He had to go to the hospital and miss schol because of this.

Because of his foot
Allen had a hard time walking to class
And he fell on the icy road again
But this time
It's not all terrible
A beautiful girl helps him get up

"U alright?" asked the girl
"yeah I'm fine. Thanks!...ahh" Al tried to make a step forward
but his ankel hurts so badly
"where do you live? I've got no class this afternoon
I can probably help you get home if it's not too far"
Al wanted to say no, but his ankel looks no good
he glanced at the girl's eyes
she seems a little shy and moved her eyes away quickly...

After a while, Al felt better
Al looked at that girl and asked
"Can u do me a favor?"
"Please say it" the girl said
"Can u call my roommate and let him get here for help."
The girl had to call Al's roommate
Soon, Al's roommate came and helped Al get back to dorm safely
"Students in our school are warm-heart!" Al said to his roomate.
His roommates made some soup for him and Al was really happy. Then he
called the girl and told her how grateful he was. The soup was really good and allowed he
to heal and get ready for school again. The end.
